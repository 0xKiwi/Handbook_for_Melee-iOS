        <br>
        <br>Sit as far back in the chair as possible,
        with your back straight and shoulders back and relaxed.
        <br>
        <br>Distribute your weight on your hips evenly.
        <br>
        <br>Keep your knees at a 90 degree angle; your knees should be even with
        or slightly higher than your hips (try not to cross your legs).
        <br>
        <br>Try not to sit in the same position for more than 30 minutes.
        <br>
        <br>When getting out of the chair, don't use your waist or back to get
        up, use your legs. It helps to slide forward in the chair first.
        <br>
        <br>With all that said, most people don't sit with correct posture
        (I'm working on my posture) so implementing this for the first time
        at a tournament may not be a good idea.
        <br>
        <br>Practice good sitting posture when on the computer, practicing
        Melee, or whenever you're sitting. Doing so will get the correct
        muscles strong enough so it becomes comfortable.
        <br>
        <br>Whenever you're uncomfortable with your sitting position, change
        it. If your legs, back, neck, or shoulders are bothering you after
        a tournament, you should fix your posture.

        <br><big><b>Mental Exercise</b></big>
        <br>Make and keep your mind quick and buff - by using it! Puzzles,
        thought-provoking movies, reading, board games, practicing
        remembering/visualizing things, and other video games are good ways
        to exercise the brain. Plus, there are tons of 'brain power' games
        and sites these days (Luminosity is a popular site)
        <br>
        <br>A daily meditation habit has been shown to improve attention and
        focus, both very important for competitive play [Here are some guided
        meditations to help you out]
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Physical Exercise</b></big>
        <br>Having good cardiovascular fitness will help blood flow to the
        brain, thus more 'mind power' - helps improve memory and maybe even
        decision making abilities. You don't have to become a bodybuilder
        or tri-athlete, you just need to keep good cardiovascular and heart
        fitness. Aerobic exercises like running, biking, swimming, and even
        walking keep the heart happy. Anaerobic exercises are great too, as
        long as you keep your heart-rate up. Tip: If/when you're practicing
        techskill by yourself (vs a CPU or whatever), every stock you lose
        during your practice session is how many pushups/pullups/situps you
        do throughout the day (or right after practicing); or, for every
        stock that's how many minutes you're going to walk today or run/swim
        throughout the week. (Also, be sure to check out the SWF Gym thread
        to get in contact of other Smasher who want/like to exercise)​
        Rest your mind
        <br>
        <br>Sometimes, you just need to stop thinking. On a day to day basis,
        and to rest from thought-heavy situations.
        <br>A tournament can be hard on your mental capacities, so finding
        things to remove your thoughts from the stress, commotion, yomi,
        and whatever else your thoughts are on will be helpful in being a
        ble to focus throughout a tournament.​
        <br>Music in a pair of headphones helps 'remove' yourself from the
        environment and give yourself a break.
        <br>Meditation, though takes practice, can be invaluable to a competitor
        since it can help remove distractions at the tournament (or in your
        life), and help you focus.
        Any activity that takes your mind off things and doesn't require
        much (new) thinking: Juggling, tetris, drawing, sleeping, taking a
        walk, etc. Whatever works for you.
        <br>If you're feeling tired, try to take a nap. Even naps that are
        around 10 minutes can improve your alertness and performance (at
        least for a little while) - but don't sleep for longer than 30
        minutes.
        <br>When trying to learn new techniques (or characters), it's good
        to rest your mind after the practice and learning - it's makes
        the learning more effective
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Fuel your brain</b></big>
        <br>Your brain LOVES glucose, and uses a bunch of it. So to make sure
        your mind has enough fuel, snack up on carbs during a tournament.​
        <br>Complex Carbs: These are the long-lasting, time-releasing carbs.
        Whole grains, fruits, and veggies provide these. Recommended for
        your 'bigger' meals when you have a good amount of down time.
        <br>Simple Carbs: The short-term, instant-boost type of carbs.
        Basically anything that is artificially sweetened with sugar
        and corn syrup: candy, soda, chocolate, jam; and even fruits and
        juices. Recommended for the mini-snack in between/before matches.
        <br>Hunger Affects Decision-Making and Perception of Risk: Eat and
        think well.
